    "synopsis": "The cryptids have hidden for centuries, becoming legends and myths. But humanity's expansion threatens their last sanctuaries. The great cryptid council convenes for the first time in a thousand years - the Wild Hunt begins.",
    "prologue": "They called us myths. Legends. Hoaxes. We let them believe it, retreating deeper into the wilderness as they spread across the land like a plague. But there is nowhere left to retreat. The forests burn. The swamps drain. The mountains crumble. The council of elder cryptids has been silent for a millennium. No longer. The Wild Hunt rides again.",
    "epilogue": "The treaty is signed. Vast nature preserves, protected by both law and cryptid guardians, now span the continents. Humanity has learned to share the world with the creatures of legend. And in the deep woods, around campfires, new stories are told - not of monsters in the darkness, but of ancient beings who fought to save the wild.",
