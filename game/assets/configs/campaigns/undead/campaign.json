    "synopsis": "The Lich King Malachar has awoken from his millennia-long slumber. With necromantic power beyond measure, he raises armies from the very battlefields he conquers. The living will serve him - in death.",
    "prologue": "In ancient times, the necromancer Malachar sought to end death itself. He succeeded - but at a terrible cost. Now neither alive nor dead, he exists as the Lich King, bound to an eternity of undeath. For a thousand years he waited in his frozen tomb. Now the seals weaken, and Malachar rises to finish what he began - the unification of all souls under his dominion.",
    "epilogue": "The mortal kingdoms have fallen. Every corpse rises to serve. Every battlefield yields fresh recruits. The Lich King's dominion spreads like a plague across the land. And yet... Malachar feels something he has not felt in a millennium. With unlimited power at his command, he begins to remember what it meant to be human.",
